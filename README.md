# ❄️ Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (with [Bun](https://bun.sh/)).

## Running the code

> ⚠️ My input files are not committed [as per request](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zh2hk0/2022friendly_reminder_dont_commit_your_input/) of the Advent of Code author.

1. Make sure [Bun](https://bun.sh/) is installed on the system (macOS and Linux only).
2. Add the input in a file named `input.txt` next to the solution before running.
3. Run: `bun src/{day_number}/main.ts`
